## Welcome to Reasons Why I Want to Cry

Welcome to Reasons Why I Want to Cry, where we'll be discussing the meaning of life and how it doesn't apply to me.



### 13 Reasons Why I Currently Want to Engage in Hysterics:

1. I failed my last Physics test.
2. I failed my last Math Analysis test.
3. I was called up to the couselor's office to discuss said Physics test.
4. I can't seem to stop falling asleep in AP US History.
5. I can't blame anyone for the fact that I fall asleep so often when the sole reason for it is because of my sleep scheduleâ€”or lack thereof.
6. When I was at the previously mentioned couselor's office, my APUSH teacher recognized me. I suspect this to be because of the fact that I slept through around thirty minutes of his class earlier today, which no doubt made me quite conspicuous. It greatly concerns me that he recogized me so readily.
7. I have a trigonometry quiz tomorrow.
8. I have a Japanese quiz tomorrow.
9. I have a Physics test tomorrow.
10. My APUSH Unit 1-3 test is tomorrow.
11. The time is currently 11:15 PM on Thursday, September 30th, and as I haven't slept in around 32 hours, I feel significantly more dead inside than usual.
12. I'd like to stop working right now, but I have more homework to do since my teachers like piling up homework and tests on Fridays.
13. I really want to take a nap.
